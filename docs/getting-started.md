# Getting Started

Welcome to ZotFlow! Before you dive into installation, this guide first introduces the **key concepts** and **design philosophy** behind ZotFlow. Understanding these ideas up front will make every other doc — and every setting you tweak — make a lot more sense.

## Part 1 — Key Concepts & Design Philosophy

ZotFlow isn't just "Zotero inside Obsidian." It's a particular _way_ of working with literature in your vault, shaped by a few opinionated choices. Here are the ideas to keep in your head as you use it.

### 1. Stay in the Flow

The whole point of ZotFlow is to **eliminate app-switching**. Reading, annotating, citing, note-taking — they should all happen inside one tool, with one set of keybindings, in one theme. Every feature in ZotFlow is designed to remove a reason to leave Obsidian.

### 2. Zotero Is the Source of Truth (Mostly)

Your Zotero library is the canonical store for your references. ZotFlow:

- **Pulls** metadata, items, collections, and annotations from Zotero into a local IndexedDB cache.
- **Pushes** changes you make in Obsidian (annotations, edits) back to Zotero — if you let it.

Each library you have access to is configured independently as one of:

| Mode              | What it does                                                                           |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bidirectional** | Pulls from Zotero and pushes local changes back. Requires write access on the API key. |
| **Read Only**     | Pulls only. Your local annotations stay local and never reach Zotero.                  |
| **Ignored**       | Skipped entirely during sync.                                                          |

When the same field changes in both places between syncs, a **field-level diff viewer** lets you decide which side wins.

### 3. Source Notes: One Note Per Item, Auto-Generated, Locked

For every Zotero item you sync, ZotFlow can generate one Markdown file — a **source note**. This is the central idea of ZotFlow's note model:

- **One note per source.** A stable, addressable node in your knowledge graph for every paper or book.
- **Auto-generated from a template.** You define the template (with [LiquidJS](https://liquidjs.com)); ZotFlow fills in metadata, child notes, attachments, and annotations.
- **Locked by default.** Source notes carry a `zotflow-locked: true` frontmatter flag, open in reading view, and are read-only. They re-render whenever the underlying item or its annotations change.

#### Link, don't edit

Source notes capture **what the author said**. Your own thinking — interpretations, critiques, ideas the paper sparked — belongs in **separate notes** that link back to the source note. This boundary is the single most important thing to internalize:

> 🧠 **The source note is _not_ your note. It's the author's note, automatically maintained for you. Your notes link _to_ it.**

This is a Zettelkasten-flavored design: stable, atomic, never-rewritten reference nodes — surrounded by your own evolving, editable insight notes.

#### Zotero Item Notes: editable regions & the standalone editor

Zotero **child notes** (note items attached to a parent paper, book, etc.) are the most important exception to the "locked" rule. ZotFlow treats them as **first-class, editable objects** with two equivalent editing surfaces — both write to the same record in IndexedDB and both push back on the next bidirectional sync.

- **Editable region inside the source note** — every child note rendered into a source note is fenced by hidden `ZF_NOTE_BEG_<key>` / `ZF_NOTE_END_<key>` HTML comments. In Source / Live Preview mode the region shows a small **🔒 lock icon** at its start; click to unlock and edit in place. Annotation comments work the same way (fenced by `ZF_ANNO_…` markers).
- **Standalone Note Editor view** — double-click a `📝` note in the Tree View (or use the `Open note` action) to open the same child note in its own Obsidian tab, powered by the full embeddable Markdown editor. Right-click any non-attachment item to **Create child note** or right-click a note to **Delete note**.

In both surfaces, edits are debounced (~2 s), converted from Markdown back to Zotero-flavored HTML, written to IndexedDB, and pushed to Zotero on the next bidirectional sync. Everything else inside the source note body (the annotation excerpt itself, generated structure, headings) stays locked and template-driven. You can globally flip the default with **Settings → ZotFlow → General → Default Editable Region Locked**; libraries set to **Read-Only** disable the unlock icon and load the Note Editor in read-only mode.

See the [Item Notes guide](item-notes.md) for the full create / edit / delete workflow.

**Frontmatter is the other exception.** The YAML frontmatter block at the top of a source note is **always editable** — you can add your own fields (tags, status, custom metadata) freely. On the next re-render, ZotFlow **merges**: template-defined fields are refreshed from Zotero, mandatory fields (`zotflow-locked`, `library-id`, `zotero-key`, `item-version`) are re-asserted, and any custom fields you added are preserved untouched.

### 4. Two Reader Modes: Library vs Local

ZotFlow's built-in reader (the same engine Zotero uses for PDFs, EPUBs, and HTML snapshots, themed to match Obsidian) works in two modes:

| Mode               | What it reads                                        | Where annotations live                                       |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Library Reader** | Attachments from your synced Zotero library          | In Zotero (synced back via bidirectional sync)               |
| **Local Reader**   | PDF/EPUB/HTML files that live directly in your vault | In a co-located `.zf.json` **sidecar file** next to the file |

The Local Reader is opt-in: enable **Settings → ZotFlow → General → Overwrite PDF/EPUB/HTML Viewer** to make any vault PDF/EPUB/HTML open in ZotFlow's reader. Local annotations never touch Zotero.

### 5. Templates Are Everywhere

ZotFlow is **template-first**. Almost everything user-facing is rendered through a LiquidJS template you can customize:

- The path where a source note is created.
- The body of library source notes.
- The body of local source notes.
- Every citation format (Pandoc, Wikilink, Footnote, Citekey, Embed).

If you don't like the default output, you don't file a feature request — you edit the template. See the [Template Guide](template-guide.md) for the full variable and filter reference.

### 6. Offline-First

Every Zotero item, collection, and library you sync is cached locally in IndexedDB. After the first sync you can browse, read, search, and edit annotations **with no network connection**. Network is only used for two things:

- Syncing with the Zotero Web API.
- Downloading attachments (from Zotero cloud storage or your WebDAV server).

Cached attachment files are managed with an LRU policy and a size limit you control.

### 7. The Two Main Surfaces

You'll interact with ZotFlow mostly through two UI surfaces. Get familiar with these and you know your way around:

- **🌳 Zotero Tree View** (sidebar) — your navigation. Browse libraries → collections → items → attachments. Search, sort, drag items to cite them, double-click attachments to open them.
- **⚙️ Activity Center** (modal, opened from ribbon) — your control panel. Trigger syncs, watch task progress, inspect the log console, test templates.

### 8. Privacy & Security by Default

- No telemetry, analytics, or third-party tracking.
- Network calls go only to the Zotero API and your configured WebDAV.
- API keys and WebDAV passwords are stored in Obsidian's platform-native `SecretStorage` — **not** in your synced `data.json`.

## Part 2 — Installation

ZotFlow is available in the official Obsidian Community Plugins store. Pre-release builds are also available via BRAT.

### Option A — Community Plugins (recommended)

1. Open Obsidian → **Settings (⚙️) → Community plugins**.
2. Make sure **Restricted mode** is **off**.
3. Click **Browse**, search for **ZotFlow**, click **Install**, then **Enable**.

Direct link: [https://community.obsidian.md/plugins/zotflow](https://community.obsidian.md/plugins/zotflow)

### Option B — Beta builds via BRAT

Use this path if you want early access to features that haven't been promoted to the stable release yet.

1. **Install BRAT**
    - Open Obsidian → **Settings (⚙️) → Community plugins**.
    - Click **Browse**, search for "BRAT", install and enable it.

2. **Add ZotFlow as a beta plugin**
    - In Community plugins, click **Options** next to **BRAT**.
    - Click **Add Beta plugin**.
    - Enter the repository: `duanxianpi/obsidian-zotflow`
    - Click **Add Plugin**.

3. **Enable ZotFlow**
    - Back in **Settings → Community plugins**, find **ZotFlow**.
    - Toggle it on.

## Part 3 — Connect to Zotero

### Create a Zotero API Key

1. Go to [https://www.zotero.org/settings/keys/new](https://www.zotero.org/settings/keys/new).
2. Give the key a descriptive name (e.g., "ZotFlow").
3. Under **Personal Library**, check **Allow library access** and **Allow write access** (the latter is required for bidirectional sync).
4. If you use group libraries, grant access to the groups you want to sync.
5. Click **Save Key** and copy the generated key.

### Add the Key to ZotFlow

1. Open **Settings → ZotFlow → Sync**.
2. Paste the API key into the **API Key** field.
3. Click **Verify Key**.
    - ZotFlow validates the key, fetches your user info, and discovers all accessible libraries.
    - On success, a **Verified** badge appears next to the key field.
4. A **Library Synchronization** table appears with every library you can access.

### Pick a Sync Mode per Library

For each library in the table, pick a sync mode (see the [concept above](#2-zotero-is-the-source-of-truth-mostly)):

- **Bidirectional** — pulls _and_ pushes.
- **Read Only** — pulls only.
- **Ignored** — skipped.

You can change this any time.

---

## Part 4 — Run Your First Sync

1. Click the **ZotFlow ribbon icon** (left sidebar) to open the **Activity Center**.
2. Go to the **Sync** tab.
3. Click **Sync All** to sync every non-ignored library, or click **Sync** on a specific library.
4. Watch progress in the **Tasks** tab.
5. When the task completes, your Zotero items are cached locally. You're now offline-ready.

---

## Part 5 — Browse Your Library

1. Open the **Zotero Tree View**:
    - Command palette → `ZotFlow: Open Zotero Tree View`, or
    - Click the Library icon in the left sidebar.
2. Expand libraries → collections → items → attachments.
3. Use the **search bar** at the top to filter items.
4. **Double-click** an attachment to open it in the reader.
5. **Drag** a regular item into any note to insert a citation.

---

## Part 6 — Optional Setup

### WebDAV (Self-Hosted Attachments)

If your Zotero attachments live on a WebDAV server instead of Zotero cloud storage:

1. **Settings → ZotFlow → WebDAV**.
2. Enable **WebDAV Sync**.
3. Enter **Server URL**, **Username**, **Password**.
4. Click **Verify & Connect**.

### Attachment Cache

ZotFlow caches downloaded attachments for fast reopening.

- **Settings → ZotFlow → Cache → Enable Cache** (default: on).
- Set a **size limit** in MB (default: 500 MB). Oldest files are evicted first.
- Click **Purge Cache** to clear everything.

### Linked Attachment Base Directory

If you use Zotero's **Linked Attachment Base Directory** (Zotero → Preferences → Advanced → Files and Folders), tell ZotFlow where those files live:

1. **Settings → ZotFlow → General → Linked Attachment Base Directory**.
2. Enter the **same absolute path** you set in Zotero (e.g., `D:\Papers` or `/Users/name/Papers`).
3. Attachments stored as `attachments:papers/foo.pdf` will resolve to `D:\Papers\papers\foo.pdf`.

Skip this step if you don't use linked attachments.

### Local Reader for Vault Files

To open _any_ PDF/EPUB/HTML in your vault with the ZotFlow reader:

1. **Settings → ZotFlow → General → Overwrite PDF/EPUB/HTML Viewer** → enable.
2. **Restart Obsidian.**
3. Vault PDFs/EPUBs/HTMLs now open in the ZotFlow reader; annotations save to `.zf.json` sidecar files.
